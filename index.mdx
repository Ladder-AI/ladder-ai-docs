[Ladder AI](https://github.com/Ladder-AI/ladder-ai) is a modular framework for self-improving Large Language Models (LLMs) via recursive problem decomposition and test-time reinforcement learning.

This project is a reimplementation and extension of the ideas from the paper:
[LADDER: Self-Improving LLMs Through Recursive Problem Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00735).

## Why Ladder?

1. **No Curated Datasets or Human Feedback Needed** \
   Ladder empowers LLMs to improve autonomously by generating and solving their own progressively simpler variants of complex problems, eliminating the need for labeled datasets or human intervention.

2. **Structured Self-Learning and Curriculum Creation** \
   The recursive decomposition process forms a natural difficulty gradient, allowing the model to build a curriculum tailored to its current capabilities and learn incrementally.

3. **Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL)** \
   Ladder extends to inference time, where models dynamically generate and solve new variants of test problems, achieving state-of-the-art results—such as 90% accuracy on the MIT Integration Bee, outperforming even OpenAI’s o1 model.

4. **Generalizable and Cost-Effective** \
   The approach is domain-agnostic and can be applied wherever formal verification is possible, including math, programming, and theorem proving. It is highly scalable and cost-effective, as it does not require external data or expensive human annotation.

5. **Moves Beyond Naive Scaling** \
   Ladder demonstrates that strategic self-improvement and recursive learning can unlock new capabilities in LLMs, challenging the notion that bigger models alone drive progress.
