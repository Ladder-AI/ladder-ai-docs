title: Dataset Generation
description: "Learn how Ladder AI autonomously generates training datasets through recursive problem decomposition, variant generation, and automated solution verification—eliminating the need for external data or human labeling."
---

Ladder AI introduces a novel approach to dataset generation for Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging the model’s own reasoning abilities. Instead of relying on curated datasets or manual labeling, Ladder creates a self-improving training process through recursive problem decomposition and automated feedback.
