title: 1. Math Problem
---

The main problem selected to apply the ladder algorithm on is to select the nearest point on a curve to a specific point
I tested this problem over many intelligent models and they even failed to sovle it even for linear equation until u force the model
to do reasoning or multisteps and u gonna find also some hallucinations in the output.

# 1- Dataset Generation

First I used `gpt-3 turbo` Model for the dataset generation process using the following problem description and example

```py
from ladder.schema import Example

problem_description = """
                    Given a curve / line equation and a specific point, find the nearest point on the curve
                    to the given point. Provide your final answer directly as a tuple (x, y) without
                    any additional explanation or commentary.
                    NOTES:
                        1. always mention the point as (x, y) in your question
                        2. dont mention word points like origin, point on x axis always specifie x and y of the point
                        3. curve could be any degree 1,2,3... huge diverse output
                        4. Dont mention any other variables in the given equation like a,t , ... only y in terms of x like y = x**2 + 2
                        5. Make sure maxium equation power u generate is 5
                    IMPORTANT: Make sure the represented curve or line is just one equation dont mention multiple equations
                    """
examples = [
   Example(
    question="Find the point on the curve defined by the equation y = 2x**2 + 5*x - 3 that is closest to the point (6, -1). Provide the coordinates of this nearest point as a tuple (x, y) without any additional explanation or commentary.",
    answer="(2,1)"
)
]
```

The First Model selected for the Ladder Finetuning Test was `metallama 3.1 8b`

```py
config = LadderConfig(
    # 1- Main LLM for dataset generation, ladder implementation
    instructor_llm = OpenAIModel(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY") ),
    # instructor_llm=TogetherAIModel(model="deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B",api_key="79da0f0c5a2c5dca6c1d6416bec24640b710d86dd4e615aff8e2759af4a10239"),
    # 2- To the run the same LLM for finetuning
    finetune_llm_runner = GroqModel(model="llama-3.1-8b-instant", api_key="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"),

    # 3- Target LLM to finetune (hugginfacehub compatible)
    target_finetune_llm_id="meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",

    # 4- Number of steps to finetune
    num_train_epochs=1,

```

# 2- Custom Verification Engine
